\chapter{Systematic Uncertainties in the Short Baseline Neutrino Program}

Why constrain systematics, and which ones are most important.  

\section{General Framework for quantification of uncertainties}

Multiverse analysis, drawing from physical distributions and propagating to the end distributions.  Reweighting method.

\section{Determination of Covariance Matrices}

Covariance formula, etc. Correlation matrix, discussion of the meaning of the correlation matrix.  Correlations between detectors within the same event sample, also nue to numu correlations.

\section{Uncertainties from Neutrino Flux}

Detailed discussion of the origins of the flux uncertainties.  The physical parameters that we have to constrain, and where the uncertainty ranges come from.  Dead-reckoned uncertainties in the event rates for each uncertainty, if possible, and dead-reckoned total uncertainty at each detector.
