\chapter{Conclusions} 

% Neutrino physics has grown substantially since the initial discovery of the neutrino, and is entering an era where deviations of even a few percent from the expect model of neutrino oscillations and interactions are detectable.  The next generation of neutrino detectors are already turning on: fine granularity tracking detectors such as liquid argon time projection chambers are the normal
