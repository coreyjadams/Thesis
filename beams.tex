\chapter{Neutrino Beams}

Discussion of the design, realization and implementation of neutrino beams.  Proton sources, target materials, hadron interactions, horn focusing, produced particles, decay into neutrinos.  Also, discussion of beam simulation and flux estimation.  Neutrino and anti-neutrino running.

\section{Neutrinos from the Main Injector (NuMI Beam)}

History. Numi design and beam set up.  Hadron production, flux prediction.  Constraints from hadron production experiments.  Constraints from NuMI experiments: MINOS, Miner$\nu$a.  Energy mode.

\section{Booster Neutrino Beam}

History.  Booster design with MiniBooNE in mind.  HARP constraints, MiniBooNE flux estimates.  Miniboone multisim constraints, current status.
