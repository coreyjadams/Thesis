Electron neutrinos are at the center of the U.S. and international accelerator based neutrino program.  They are the flagship oscillation channel for DUNE, \uboone, and the Fermilab Short Baseline Neutrino Program.  Liquid argon time projection chambers are the forefront of neutrino detection technology, and the detector of choice for both short and long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

This work presents the first experimental observation and study of electron neutrinos in the 1-10 GeV range, the essential oscillation energy regime for the above experiments.  The systematic uncertainties for an electron neutrino appearance search for the Fermilab Short Baseline Neutrino Program are carefully quantified, and the characterization of separation between electrons and high energy photons is examined.
