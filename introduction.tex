\chapter{Introduction}
Your first chapter is probably an introduction. But who knows. Check out Eq.\ (\ref{that_right_triangle_rule})!
Note that after Eq.\ and Fig.\ you want to use `.\textbackslash'  to use a single sized space. Otherwise,
latex will interpret it as the end of a sentence and put additional white space in between `Eq.' and 
`(\ref{that_right_triangle_rule})'.

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \label{that_right_triangle_rule}
\end{equation}
